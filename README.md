# Secret Love Letter 💌

Want to share something special with someone you love? This is a digital love letter wrapped in a beautiful interactive envelope. They'll need a secret code to open it (make it meaningful! 😉).

## How it Works

1. They visit your page
2. Enter the secret code you shared
3. Click the beating heart to open the envelope
4. Read your heartfelt message
5. Close it and open again whenever they miss you

## Quick Setup

1. Download or clone this
2. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
3. Put your message and secret code in `config.js`
4. Upload to GitHub Pages (or anywhere you like)

## Make it Yours

Open `config.js` and change:

- Your secret code (maybe your anniversary date? 💝)
- Your love letter
- Any text you want

## Privacy

Don't worry, your message stays secret:

- Only opens with the right code
- Content is hidden from nosy people
- Can't be found in page source

## Made With Love
