# Secret Love Letter üíå

A digital love letter hidden in an interactive envelope. Perfect for sharing your feelings in a unique way.

## What's This?

It's a web-based love letter that starts with a passcode (make it special!). Once opened, it reveals your message with some nice animations. The letter stays private - only people with the passcode can read it.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
3. Edit `config.js` with your message and passcode
4. Deploy it (GitHub Pages works great)

## Customizing

In your `config.js`, you can change:

- The passcode
- Your letter content
- Error messages
- Pretty much any text you see

## Privacy

The letter content is protected in a few ways:

- Passcode protected
- Content is encoded
- Not visible in page source
