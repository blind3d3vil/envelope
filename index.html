                  <h1>My Love,</h1>
                  <p>
                    There are feelings in this world that words can't contain,
                    emotions too vast for any sentence to hold. But if I could
                    tryâ€”if I could give even a glimpse of what you mean to meâ€”it
                    would be this: You are my heart, my warmth, my forever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Loving you isn't something I chooseâ€”it's something that just
                    is. As natural as breathing, as certain as the sun rising
                    each morning. It doesn't begin and end with the days; it
                    doesn't depend on time, distance, or circumstances. It just
                    existsâ€”constant, unshaken, infinite.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You are the feeling of home, no matter where I stand. You
                    are the quiet in my chaos, the light in my darkest moments.
                    You are the person I'd find in every lifetime, in every
                    world, no matter how many times I had to search.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And if ever a day comes when you forget just how deeply youz
                    are loved, remember thisâ€”there is not a single version of my
                    life where you are not everything.
                  </p>
